## Step 1: Introduction

Valorant is a competitive tactical shooter where ranking up is the core goal for many players. At the very top of the ladder, **Radiant** players represent the top 0.1%, while **Immortal** ranks (Immortal 1‚Äì3) make up the highly skilled tier just below. Understanding the differences between these two groups is useful for both competitive players and analysts: it sheds light on what performance truly separates the best from the nearly best.

Our project aims to answer the following question:

> **Among Radiant and Immortal players, what differentiates Radiants from Immortals in terms of in-game performance stats?**

### Why This Question Matters

This question is relevant because it addresses what it really takes to become one of the best players in Valorant. While many players might assume that K/D ratio is everything, our analysis explores whether other factors like team coordination, consistency, or early-round impact matter more. Competitive gamers, coaches, and game designers alike can benefit from a clearer understanding of what defines top-tier performance.

### About the Dataset

- **Dataset size**: 85,574 rows  
- **Source**: A scraped dataset of Radiant and Immortal-ranked players and their match statistics.(Kaggle)

### üîç Relevant Columns Used:

| Column Name     | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| `kd_ratio`      | Kill-to-death ratio (K/D), a core performance indicator. |
| `win_percent`   | Overall win percentage across matches. |
| `damage_round`  | Average damage dealt per round. |
| `first_bloods`  | Number of rounds where the player secured the first kill. |
| `kills_round`   | Average number of kills per round. |
| `clutches`      | Number of rounds won as the last surviving player. |
| `flawless`      | Number of flawless rounds won by the team. |
| `rating`        | Player's actual rank (Radiant, Immortal 1/2/3). |
| `agent_1`       | The agent most commonly played by the user. |

We focus our analysis on these columns to explore which gameplay stats most strongly correlate with Radiant-level success, and whether some Immortals show Radiant-like characteristics.


## Step 2: Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis

To ensure consistent and reliable analysis, we cleaned the raw `val_stats.csv` dataset through the following steps:

### 1. Parsing Numerical Columns

Several numeric features were stored as strings or had missing/invalid values. We used `pd.to_numeric(..., errors='coerce')` to convert these columns safely to numeric values, coercing invalid entries to `NaN`. The columns processed include:

- `kd_ratio`
- `win_percent`
- `wins`
- `damage_round`
- `first_bloods`
- `kills_round`
- `clutches`
- `flawless`

This step was necessary to prepare the features for aggregation, visualization, and modeling.

### 2. Dropping Incomplete Rows

We removed rows with missing values in critical performance columns to ensure accuracy in later analysis.

```python
df.dropna(subset=['kd_ratio', 'win_percent', 'damage_round', 'wins', 'clutches', 'flawless', 'first_bloods'], inplace=True)
```

This improved data quality and reliability across all statistical comparisons.

### üßç 3. Filling Missing Categorical Fields

Some non-numeric columns like player `name`, `tag`, and agent selections had blanks or missing values. We replaced these with the string `"Unknown"` to avoid errors in grouping and filtering.

```python
df['name'].replace(to_replace=['', np.nan], value='Unknown', inplace=True)
df['tag'].replace(to_replace=['', np.nan], value='Unknown', inplace=True)
df['agent_2'].replace(to_replace=['', np.nan], value='Unknown', inplace=True)
df['agent_3'].replace(to_replace=['', np.nan], value='Unknown', inplace=True)
```

### 4. Filtering for Relevant Ratings

To focus our project on the difference between **Radiant** and **Immortal** players, we filtered the dataset to only include the following ratings:

- Radiant
- Immortal 1
- Immortal 2
- Immortal 3

We then grouped all Immortal tiers together:

```python
df = df[df['rating'].isin(['Radiant', 'Immortal 1', 'Immortal 2', 'Immortal 3'])].copy()
df['rating_group'] = df['rating'].replace({
    'Immortal 1': 'Immortal',
    'Immortal 2': 'Immortal',
    'Immortal 3': 'Immortal',
    'Radiant': 'Radiant'
})
```

This allowed us to simplify comparisons and focus the model on the key question: what distinguishes Radiants from Immortals?


We limited the preview table to only key performance-related columns to ensure clarity and focus. The original dataset contains over 30 columns, but for exploratory and modeling purposes, we highlight only the most relevant metrics ‚Äî such as kill-death ratio, win rate, and clutch counts ‚Äî that align with our guiding question.

## Step 3: Problem Identification

For this project, we aim to build a **predictive classification model** that distinguishes between **Radiant** and **Immortal** players in *Valorant* based on their in-game performance statistics.

### Prediction Problem  
**Can we predict whether a player is Radiant or Immortal based on their in-game stats such as KD ratio, win percentage, and damage per round?**

This is a **binary classification** task, where the response variable is:

- `rating` ‚Äî a categorical variable with two classes: `"Radiant"` and `"Immortal"` (merged from Immortal 1, 2, and 3 for simplicity).

We chose this problem because reaching Radiant rank is extremely competitive, and identifying what makes Radiant players stand out can offer insights to aspiring high-rank players or coaches.

### Response Variable  
- **Response**: `rating`  
- **Type**: Categorical (Binary: Radiant vs. Immortal)

This was chosen because our broader research question is:  
**‚ÄúWhat differentiates Radiants from Immortals in terms of in-game performance stats?‚Äù**

By modeling this as a classification problem, we can both **predict rank tier** and **gain insight into feature importance**.

### Model Type: Predictive or Inferential  
This is a **predictive model**, not inferential. Our goal is to **accurately predict a player's rank tier**, not necessarily to interpret causal relationships between the features and the rank. The input features we use (e.g., win percentage, clutch counts, KD ratio) are **realistically known before** a rank is assigned or changed ‚Äî thus they are suitable for prediction.

### Evaluation Metric  
We will evaluate model performance using **F1-Score**, as our classes may be imbalanced (e.g., fewer Radiants than Immortals). F1-score is preferred over accuracy in this context because it balances both **precision** and **recall**, giving a better sense of model performance when one class is harder to predict correctly.
